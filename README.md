# Mandelbrot
A rough visual representation of the Mandelbrot Set, drawn by a Turtle Object
This is a beginner coding project to visualize the Mandelbrot Set. It was done using Java, 
making use of a Turtle object to draw the individual points of the set. This is by any means
a very VERY slow implementation.
